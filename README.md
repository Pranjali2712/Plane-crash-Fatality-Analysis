# Plane-crash-Fatality-Analysis
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing global airplane crashes from 1908 onwards to uncover insights into crash frequency, causes, survival rates, and seasonal trends.

Key Highlights:
• Cleaned and transformed raw dataset using Power Query
• Designed data model and built relationships for accurate filtering and interaction
• Created custom DAX measures for KPIs like Survival Rate, Fatality %, Total Crashes, and Monthly Trends
• Developed multiple interactive visuals:
 – Pie chart showing survival vs fatal crashes
 – Trend line showing fatality % over time
 – Bar/Column charts for top aircraft types and operators involved in crashes
 – Donut chart for crash cause distribution
 – Seasonal and map-based crash trend analysis
• Implemented slicers (month, year, crash category) for dynamic user-driven analysis
