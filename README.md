# Airplane Crashes Analysis – Power BI 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes global airplane crashes from 1908 onwards to uncover insights into crash frequency, causes, survival rates, and seasonal trends.  
The goal was to practice end-to-end data analysis using  Power BI, and DAX while presenting insights in a clear and interactive format.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- **Excel** → Initial cleaning & formatting  
- **Power Query** → Data transformation in Power BI  
- **Power BI Desktop** → Dashboard design, interactive visuals, KPI cards  
- **DAX Measures** → Survival rate, fatality %, monthly trends, top causes  


## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Airplane Crashes and Fatalities Since 1908](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurograndi/airplane-crashes-since-1908)  
- Rows: ~5,000+ crash records  
- Key fields: Date, Location, Operator, Fatalities, Aboard, Survivors, Cause  


## 📊 Dashboard Highlights
- **KPIs:** Total crashes, total fatalities, survival rate, fatality %  
- **Trends:** Monthly & yearly crash distribution  
- **Geography:** Map visualization of crash locations  
- **Breakdown:** Crashes by operator, time period, and cause  


## 🔑 Key Insights
- Majority of crashes occurred between 1940–1980, declining significantly in recent decades  
- Survival rates improved after 2000 with better safety protocols  
- Certain operators and regions had disproportionately higher crash frequencies  
- Seasonal variation observed, with higher crash incidents in specific months
